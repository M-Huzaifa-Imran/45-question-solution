// 6.Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use 
//each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
// Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
